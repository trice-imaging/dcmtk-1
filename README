TRICE PARTICULARS:

The only thing that is used in production is a modified 'storescp'.  The files changed are ./dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc  and ./dcmnet/apps/Makefile

The libraries made in ../baseSrc are linked into storescp (as can be seen by the Makefile)

Details for building for the "box" storescp  are found under box-extras/
Details for building for android embedded version are found under   android-extras/
Details for building for remote receiving storescp are found under cloud-extras/

storescp.cc code changes are conditionally compiled using #ifdef TRICE

This library is compiled for linux and cross-compiled for android and windows.  Some changes were needed for the cross-compiling to take place without error.  __android__ and __windows__ #ifdefs are used sparingly.

DCMTK

DCMTK contains the following sub-packages, each in its own sub-directory:

    config   - configuration utilities for DCMTK
    dcmdata  - a data encoding/decoding library and utility apps
    dcmimage - adds support for color images to dcmimgle
    dcmimgle - an image processing library and utility apps
    dcmjpeg  - a compression/decompression library and utility apps
    dcmjpls  - a compression/decompression library and utility apps
    dcmnet   - a networking library and utility apps
    dcmpstat - a presentation state library and utility apps
    dcmqrdb  - an image database server
    dcmrt    - a radiation therapy library and utility apps
    dcmsign  - a digital signature library and utility apps
    dcmsr    - a structured report library and utility apps
    dcmtls   - security extensions for the network library
    dcmwlm   - a modality worklist database server
    oflog    - a logging library based on log4cplus
    ofstd    - a library of general purpose classes

Each sub-directory (except config) contains further sub-directories for
application source code (apps), library source code (libsrc), library
include files (include), configuration data (etc), documentation (docs),
sample and support data (data) as well as test programs (tests).
